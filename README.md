- ML sub reddit
- NIPS/ICML/....

 ### GOAL
 
 
``` 
Read 50-100 Research paper to have very good understanding of that Domain.
```

**How to Read One Paper**


**Multiple Passes.**

```
        1. First pass --- Title/abstract/Figures.
        2. Intro -- Conclusion -- Figures -- skim rest.(skim the related work)
